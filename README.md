### Hi there 👋

**hugil/hugil** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working ... on a little bit of everything
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... learning new technologies together
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... not being a workaholic (just kidding)
- 💬 Ask me about ... anything, and we'll both learn about it if we need to
- 📫 How to reach me: ... just slide in to my DMs
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... this profile is reused the github premade readme.. ;)
