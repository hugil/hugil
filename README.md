### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**hugil/hugil** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working ... on building a github portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... networking (CCNA), virtualization and backend development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... learning new technologies together
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... not being a workaholic (just kidding)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything, and we'll both learn about it if we need to
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... just slide in to my DMs
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... this profile is reused the github premade readme.. ;)
